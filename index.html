    <h1>Amuse-bouche or amused Boosh?</h1>
    <p><em>Note: The images shown here are random images from <a href="http://flicker.com">flickr</a>, with either "amuse-bouche" or "the mighty boosh" as the query. There is no guarantee that the image will be an amuse-bouche or at all related to the British comedy troupe The Mighty Boosh. It is also not guaranteed that if an image is related to the British comedy troupe The Mighty Boosh, that it will be an image of any of the members appearing amused. This idea is incredibly good on paper but unrealistic and stupid in practice.</em></p>
